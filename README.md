# -Star1-CS542_socket_ICMP
In this project, we created an application program to implement a PING command by sending and receiving ICMP messages by using Row Socket in python. We accomplished the requirements of sender sends out 2 ICMP requests constantly with the length of 256 bytes (data portion/payload), the receiver sends back replies and print the requests it receives from the sender to a .txt file and when the sender receives replies, it prints the reply messages on the screen and in a .txt file as well.
